- any protocol errors close the transport
- it is a protocol error to use a stream/message id of 0
- the first time a stream id/message id pair is used, the starting bit
  must be set. it is a protocol error if not
- the first time a stream id/message id pair is used with the
  continuation bit unset, the message is no longer in use
- messages are handled in the order they finish being sent which is
  when the continuation is unset
- it is a protocol error to send different control bits for the same
  active stream id/message id pair
- it is a protocol error for a server to send invoke to a client
- invoke both allocates the stream id that messages will flow on and
  chooses the rpc
- it is a protocol error for a client to send two invokes on the same stream
- clients and servers may arbitarily close streams if too much
  buffered data or messages are present
- it is a protocol error to send data for payloads with empty bodies
- it is a protocol error to send a packet that requires a paylod body
  with no body
