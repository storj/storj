# Title: Referral Manager

## Abstract

Right now, referral program only works per satellite meaning a user on us-east-1 satellite can only refer people to join us-ease-1. 
However, it's crucial for the tardigrade branded satellites to be able to handle cross-satellite referrals. Therefore, we plan to have a program running in GCP along with tardigrade satellites to handle this issue.

## Background

Along with cross-satellite referrals, we are also working on having a sign-up page that will allow users to select which satellite
they would like to register an account with. Below design is built based on the new sign-up flow.

## Design

####Definition
*Referral Link* - _A static link that contains a unique referral code_

*Referral Code* - _An uuid generated by referral manager program for each user to be able to participate in our referral program_

#### User Flow
1. Sign up

    After new user Alice chose to register on satellite B and clicked on the create account button:
    - Satellite B sends a request with its satellite id to referral manager for a referral code for Alice
    - Referral manager receives the request from satellite B, generates an unique referral code 11111111, and then store that code, 11111111, along with the satellite B's address into referral manager's database 
    - After successfully storing the referral code and satellite B's address, referral manager sends a response with the generated referral code, 11111111, back to satellite B 
    - Satellite B receives the referral code, 11111111, from referral manager and then store it along with Alice's information into user table in satellitedb
        - Signed up WITHOUT referral link:
            - Satellite B will store Alice's credit into user_credit table with a null value in referred_by column
        - Signed up WITH referral link:
            - If user Bonnie from satellite C referred Alice with a referral link, https://C.tardigrade.io/signup/22222222
            - satellite B will store the referral code, 22222222, in user_credits table under referred_by column along with Alice's credits information.

2. Award referrer credits
    
    After user Alice has used up their free credits:
    
    - Satellite B will send a request with the referral code, 22222222, to referral manager
    - Referral manager receives the request from satellite B and use the referral code, 22222222, to look up the satellite address that's associated with the referral code, 22222222, in its database
        - If no referral code can be found in referral manager's database that's equal to 22222222
            - referral manager sends back an INVALID response to satellite B
        
        - If a satellite address, C, is found through the referral code 22222222
            - referral manager sends the referral code 22222222 to satellite C
            - referral manager sends back a OK response to satellite B
            - satellite C receives the referral code 22222222
            - satellite C looks up the user Bonnie that's associated with the referral code 22222222
            - satellite C injects a new entry into user_credits table for Bonnie for their earned referrer credits
            
## Rationale
1. Will this overload satellites?
2. Should we just have satellites communicate with each other directly?

## Implementation

#### node id authentication 
_to make sure that the node id the referral manager is talking to is one of our approved satellites_

````golang
var approvedSatellites  map[storj.NodeID]satelliteAddress
var mu sync.RWMutex
func VerifySatelliteID(ctx context.Context, id storj.NodeID) (err error) {
	if approvedSatellites {
		return nil
	}

	mu.RLock()
	defer mu.RUnlock()

	_, ok := approvedSatellites[id]
	if !ok {
		return fmt.Errorf("satellite %q is unapproved", id)
	}
	return nil
}
````


#### Referral Manager grpc Definition
````grpc
package referralmanager;

import "gogo.proto";

service ReferralManager {
    rpc Request(ReferralCodeRequest) returns (ReferralCodeResponse) {}
    rpc Inform(InformReferrerRequest) returns (InformReferrerResponse) {}
}

message ReferralCode {
    bytes satellite_id = 1 [(gogoproto.customtype) = "NodeID", (gogoproto.nullable) = false];
    string referral_code = 2;
}

message ReferralCodeRequest {
    bytes satellite_id = 1 [(gogoproto.customtype) = "NodeID", (gogoproto.nullable) = false];
    string user_id = 2;
}

message ReferralCodeResponse {
    enum Status {
        INVALID  = 0;
        SUCCESS = 1;
    }

    ReferralCode referral_code = 1;
    
    string user_id = 2;

    Status status = 3;
}

message InformReferrerRequest {
    ReferralCode referral_code = 1;
}

message InformReferrerResponse {
    enum Status {
        INVALID = 0;
        SUCCESS = 1;
    }
    
    Status status = 1;
}
````

#### Satellite grpc Endpoint Definition
````grpc
package referral

service Referral {
    rpc Update(ReferralRequest) returns (ReferralResponse) {}
}

message ReferralRequest {
    strings referral_code = 1;
    strings user_id = 2;
}

message ReferralResponse {
    enum Status {
        INVALID = 0;
        SUCCESS = 1;
    }
    
    Status status = 1;
}
````

#### Referral Manager DB Design
1. table referral_codes
````sql
    referral_code blob PRIMARY KEY 
    satellite_id blob
````

2. table satellite_info
````sql
    satellite_id blob PRIMARY KEY 
    satellite_address text
````

## Open issues (if applicable)
1. Should we also store referral offers information in referral manager so all tardigrade satellites will have the same offer running? What technical concerns that would arise?
2. Should we use signed message for the communication between satellites and referral manager?
